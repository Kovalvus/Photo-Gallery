A photo gallery

Uses html, css, js and php
Functions:
- use database to display images and their descriptions (as alt)
- change shape of images (rectangle/rounded/circle)
- change filter of images (default/grayscale/blur/high brightness/low brightness/contrast/inverted/saturation/sepia)
- change border of images (solid/dotted/dashed/double) with custom width and color

To launch you'll need to download all files, create a "root" user with no password set and create a "galeria_zdjec" database with "galeria_zdjec.sql" imported into it
